Cornell University is a private Ivy League institution located in Ithaca, New York. Founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, the university was built on the revolutionary idea that it would be a place where “any person can find instruction in any study.” Today, Cornell maintains that spirit of inclusivity and breadth by offering a wide array of programs spanning the sciences, humanities, engineering, business, design, and more. Its main campus sits on a hill overlooking Cayuga Lake, creating a unique balance of rigorous academics within a scenic, natural environment.

Cornell is known for its interdisciplinary research and strong global reputation, housing schools such as the College of Engineering, the SC Johnson College of Business, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science. It also maintains professional schools in New York City, like the Cornell Tech campus, which focuses on technology, design, and entrepreneurship. The university is especially strong in blending theory with practice, encouraging students to not only excel academically but also to engage in projects, research, and initiatives that have direct social impact.

Student life at Cornell is diverse and vibrant, with more than 1,000 student organizations, a long tradition of cultural and academic clubs, and a strong emphasis on public service and community engagement. The university’s location in Ithaca provides both natural beauty—waterfalls, gorges, and trails—and a close-knit town atmosphere, while its global campuses and partnerships extend opportunities worldwide. Cornell’s motto, “I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study,” continues to guide its mission, fostering a culture of innovation, inclusivity, and intellectual curiosity.
